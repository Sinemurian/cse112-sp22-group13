# Agenda
## Introductions
## Scheduling
* Delvin can't make it Mondays
  * Let Sanat know that Delvin can't make it to meetings to ensure no point loss.
  * Coordinate with Delvin to keep them updated to make sure they don't fall behind.

## Github Repo
* Add everyone to the Github Repo. Forking vs Branching
  * Everyone should branch the Github repo. We should assign everyone their own branch.
  * Ask Sanat whether your Github should be solely your school account or not.

## Group Bonding Event
* In-person or Zoom
  * More likely to be zoom. If needed just log in to zoom for 20 minutes so everyone can take the screenshot.
  * Possibly hanging out at Dirty Birds for the group bonding event in person.
