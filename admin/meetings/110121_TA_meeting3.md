# 11-01-21 Meeting with Sanat, Andy, Scott and Alanna

# Call to Order
TA meeting called to order at 6:30 PM.

# Notes:

Local storage, key value pairs: to store the users. If creating accounts, just one “account” and just store user’s name and password. But don’t need a log-in ultimately. Everything is just within local storage (within the user’s browser).

Log-in would be an add-in feature, don’t need a database.

Can have google authentication (sign in with google).

Figure out: if we want to support multiple users, how are we going to make sure they have specific things to them (favs, tags, etc). 

Under local storage is also something called IndexDB.

Backend and api together can explore API’s and look at the data format (json), getting the media out and throwing it up on the screen.

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 7:30 PM.
