# 10-26-21 Meeting with Sanat, Andy, Scott and Alanna

# Call to Order
The first brainstorm meeting involving Team 4 members was called to order at 7:30 PM.

Add user stories for our target audience (initially had written user personas)
Wireframes – UI – Figma
Pitch – summarize what Sanat’s seen. (pitch to a possible customer/shareholder)
	Not completely stuck with the features we pitch but shouldn’t overpromise too much
Shape Up Book: Chapter Write the Pitch pg. 57
Get this done quicker because once approved, can start coding/implementation. Don’t wait until deadline!
Should start meeting twice a week once we start coding!

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 8:30 PM.
